1) Add a top “Summary” row so the report isn’t empty-feeling

Right now you land on 2 cards → feels like “that’s it?”. Add a compact summary bar above Tech Stack:

AI Provider: Not detected (Probe ran ✅)

Framework: Unknown (Render ran ✅)

Origin Host: Unknown (behind Cloudflare)

3rd-party services: 5 detected

Confidence: High overall

Even “Unknown / Not detected” is valuable when stated clearly.

2) Split CDN/Edge vs Origin Hosting

You fixed the “Cloudflare as hosting” issue ✅. Next step is:

CDN/Edge: Cloudflare (High)

Origin hosting: Detected / Unknown / Possibly Replit (Medium)

Because your Network Activity shows replit.com — that’s a signal worth surfacing as Possible origin / platform, even if you keep it Medium.

3) Fix “API Paths” → “Requested Paths” + filter Cloudflare noise

Those paths (/cdn-cgi/*, /beacon.min.js, etc.) aren’t “API”. Rename and reduce noise:

Requested paths (top 10)

Toggle: Hide platform noise (Cloudflare /cdn-cgi, beacon, fonts, etc.)

Also remove the first-party domain from “External Domains” (right now it lists aitracker.run as external).

4) Deduplicate “Third-Party Services” vs “Network Activity”

They overlap. Make one canonical section:

Third-party services (grouped)

Analytics: GA4 (google-analytics.com, googletagmanager.com)

Fonts: Google Fonts (fonts.googleapis.com, fonts.gstatic.com)

Performance: Cloudflare Insights (static.cloudflareinsights.com)

Each group expands to show evidence + domains.

5) Group evidence by technology (makes it feel more “engineered”)

Instead of one big “Detection Signals” list, do:

Cloudflare — High (score 0.92)

Header: cf-ray:*

Header: server: cloudflare

Header: cf-cache-status:*

GA4 — High (score 0.90)

Script: googletagmanager.com/gtag

HTML: gtag('config' …)

HTML: G-XXXX

This reads like a professional forensic report.

Make it feel “AI-era” even when AI isn’t detected
6) Add an “AI Stack” card group (always visible)

Even if empty, show:

AI Provider: Not detected

AI Gateway: Not detected

Streaming: Not detected

AI UI found: No obvious chat widget

And include “Why not?” helper text:

“No calls to known LLM endpoints were observed in browser network activity. This app may call AI server-side only, or behind a proxy.”

This prevents users from thinking the product “failed”.

7) Add “Probe coverage” diagnostics (key for trust)

Probe mode is brittle. Show a small “Probe log” summary:

Page loaded ✅

Interactive elements clicked: 0 / 3 attempted

Chat UI found: No

Total requests captured: 78

External domains: 6

If probe didn’t actually interact, the user understands why AI wasn’t detected.

Growth/viral improvements
8) Add a shareable “Stack Card” at the top

A compact, screenshot-friendly card:

AIHackr Stack Card — aitracker.run
Cloudflare • GA4 • (AI not detected)
[Copy link] [Embed badge]

Your current Share button is fine, but “Copy link” + “Embed badge” will drive distribution.

9) Add 2 CTAs inside the report (not just footer)

Compare vs competitor (enter another URL)

Monitor this site weekly (Pro)

These are your natural monetization bridges.

Small polish items (quick wins)

“Scanned 1/9/2026” → add time + timezone, and a “Rescan” button.

In Network Activity, show counts: googletagmanager.com (12 req).

Expand/collapse sections; default Evidence collapsed to keep report “executive first”.
