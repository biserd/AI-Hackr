Here’s a landing-page copy kit for AIHackr that’s crisp, evidence-based (no overclaims), and built around one primary action: scan a URL.

Positioning

AIHackr reverse-engineers any SaaS and generates an “AI Stack Card” — framework, hosting, payments, analytics, auth, and (when detectable) the LLM/provider — with receipts + confidence.

⸻

Above-the-fold (hero)

Headline options (pick one)
	1.	What’s this SaaS built with—especially the AI stack?
	2.	Reverse-engineer any SaaS: stack + AI provider, with receipts.
	3.	The “BuiltWith” for AI SaaS—without the guesswork.

Subheadline (tight + honest)
Paste a URL to get a shareable Stack Card: framework, hosting, Stripe/auth/analytics—and AI provider signals when they’re publicly detectable (with confidence levels and evidence).

Primary CTA (big button)
Scan a URL →

Input placeholder
example.com

Secondary CTA (text link next to button)
See a sample report

Trust microcopy (under CTA)
Free passive scan. Probe scan available for deeper detection.

⸻

Problem → Promise (3 bullets)

Stop guessing what competitors are running.
	•	See the stack in seconds (Next/Vercel/Stripe/Clerk/etc.)
	•	Detect AI provider signals when they leak (OpenAI / Gemini / Anthropic / Azure)
	•	Every claim comes with evidence + confidence (High / Medium / Low)

⸻

“How it works” (3 steps)
	1.	We scan the public surface (HTML, headers, scripts, DNS)
	2.	Optional probe scan captures network calls during real interactions
	3.	You get an AI Stack Card with receipts, confidence, and a share badge

CTA under this section: Run a scan

What you get (deliverables)

	•	Stack summary: framework, hosting/CDN, payments, auth, analytics, support

	•	Share card: public URL + embed badge
	•	Change history (Pro): what changed since last scan

CTA strategy (clear + actionable)

You want one primary CTA throughout: Scan a URL
And two secondary CTAs:
	•	See a sample report (reduces anxiety)
	•	Probe scan (for power users, behind Pro or as a one-off upgrade)

Suggested button labels
	•	Primary: Scan a URL →
	•	Secondary: View sample report
	•	Upgrade moment: Run a deeper probe scan

⸻

Optional: “sticky” CTA bar (high conversion)

A small bar that stays on scroll:
	•	Input + Scan
	•	Link: Sample report

If you tell me your preferred vibe (minimal/technical vs bold/viral), I’ll rewrite this into a single polished page (hero → sections → FAQs) with two versions: one optimized for builders and one for growth/marketers.
