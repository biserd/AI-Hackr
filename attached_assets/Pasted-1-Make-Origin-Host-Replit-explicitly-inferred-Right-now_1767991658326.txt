1) Make “Origin Host: Replit” explicitly inferred

Right now it reads like a fact. Since Cloudflare sits in front, “origin” is often guessy.

Change to: Origin host (inferred): Replit — Medium

Add a tiny “Why” hover: “Observed replit.com + replit-dev-banner asset in network activity.”

If you can’t prove it (DNS/CNAME/origin headers), label it Possible.

2) Fix the mismatch: “3rd-party 7 detected” vs “Third-Party Services” showing 1

You already list 7 external domains in Network Activity, but “Third-Party Services” only shows GTM.

Make one canonical “Services detected (7)” section and group by vendor:

Google Analytics/Tag Manager (googletagmanager.com, google-analytics.com, /g/collect)

Google Fonts (fonts.googleapis.com, fonts.gstatic.com)

Cloudflare Insights (static.cloudflareinsights.com)

Replit (replit.com) (if you keep it as 3rd party)

Then you can delete the separate “Third-Party Services” block or turn it into that grouped view.

3) Rename “Confidence: Medium” to “Overall confidence” + explain why

Overall confidence being “Medium” makes people wonder if the whole thing is shaky.

Show Overall confidence: Medium

Subtext: “Medium because framework not detected and origin host is inferred.”

Keep per-item confidence on each tech card (already good).

4) Probe Coverage: “Elements clicked 0/0” reads broken

Change it to something explicit:

Candidates found: 0

Clicked: 0

Chat UI found: No

And add a CTA when probe can’t find anything:

“Probe a specific path” (user enters /chat, /assistant, etc.)

or “Tell us where the AI feature lives” (input field)

5) AI Stack wording: “AI not detected” → “No public AI signal”

This avoids the wrong interpretation (“this product doesn’t use AI”).

Suggested copy:

Provider: No public signal

Gateway: Not observed

Chat UI: Not found

Helper: “This app may call AI server-side only, behind a proxy, or only after login.”

6) Network Activity: add counts + separate first-party vs third-party

Make it more forensic and less “chip spam”:

Requests captured: 21

External domains: 7

Show per-domain counts: www.googletagmanager.com (5) etc.

Split “Requested paths” into:

First-party paths

Third-party paths (like /g/collect)

7) Share UX: reduce duplication

You have Copy link (top card) + Share (report header). Consider:

Keep Copy link in the Stack Card

Make Share a dropdown: Copy link / Copy image / Copy badge / Embed

8) Add one more “View all detections” affordance

Because Tech Stack shows only 2 cards, it can feel sparse. Add:

“View all (7)” which expands into the grouped services list.

If you implement just #1–#4 and #2, the report will feel significantly more authoritative and less “tool-y”.
